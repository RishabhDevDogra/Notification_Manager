# **Notification Manager**

**A scalable notification management system demonstrating clean architecture and event-driven design in C# (.NET 6, Windows Forms)**  

This project was originally built during my college days as an **early exploration of event-driven programming, delegates, and subscriber-safe notifications**. It allows sending notifications via **Email or SMS** while ensuring **no duplicate notifications are sent to the same subscriber**.  

Since then, the concepts of **clean architecture, event-driven systems, and immutable data handling** have been applied in professional production systems, handling **large-scale messaging, automation workflows, and real-world business impact**.

## **Key Features**

- **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Send messages via **Email** or **SMS**  
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Automatically ensures each subscriber receives only **one notification**  
- **Event-Driven Design:** Uses **delegates and events** for scalable and maintainable notification handling  
- **Clean Separation of Concerns:** UI, notification logic, and delivery methods are clearly separated  
- **Extensible Architecture:** Can easily add new channels or scheduling mechanisms

## **Technical Highlights**

- **C# & .NET 6 Windows Forms**  
- **Delegates & Event-Driven Programming**  
- **Immutable Subscriber List** ensures reliability  
- **Backend Logic Ready for Scale:** Can be extended to enterprise-level systems

## **Usage**

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**  
2. Add subscribers via **Email** or **Mobile Number**  
3. Publish notifications via the **UI**  
4. The system validates subscribers to prevent duplicates and sends notifications
